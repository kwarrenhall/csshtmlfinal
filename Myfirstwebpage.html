        <h2>what is programing?</h2>
          <p>The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic.</p>

        <h2>What is software development?</h2>
        <p>Within software engineering, programming (the implementation) is regarded as one phase in a software development process.
        There is an ongoing debate on the extent to which the writing of programs is an art form, a craft, or an engineering discipline.[3] In general, good programming is considered to be the measured application of all three, with the goal of producing an efficient and evolvable software solution (the criteria for "efficient" and "evolvable" vary considerably). </P>

      <h2>Different approaches to developing applications.</h2>
        <p>Mobile devices are the fastest-growing enterprise platforms in IT.  There are two different approaches to developing programing for mobil apps.  The firt is develop code for a website and run the different mobil apps through the website.  The other option is to create a dedicated app for each mobile device. There are obvious costs associated with developing a separate app for each platform, but there are advantages, as well. One of the most important is that performance of a dedicated app will almost certainly be better than the performance of an app that has to run through a browser for everything that happens.  This is why knowing what languages are used for what application is important.</p>
